# Tch_depth

fork from tch. 

now the torch is from conda/pip. I've frozen it to 1.3 to run this https://github.com/frederico-klein/depth_estimation_with_densenet-unet_hybrid

~~everything else is version matched so that this works. cv2, rospy and torch are being imported in python 3.6, but that's about it, there is nothing else working/tested. ~~

it runs the network. this can be used to do projects that use an old torch/cudnn and ros kinetic with python 3 support
